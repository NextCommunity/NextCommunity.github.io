bio: |
  I am a developer who learns by building projects and figuring things out along the way. I mostly work on the front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, focusing on clean layouts and code that actually works.

  I have also worked with Java, PHP, and C, which helped me understand core programming concepts instead of just relying on frameworks. I keep my work on GitHub and use it to practice, experiment, and improve.
  Still learning. Still building. Trying to get better with every project.

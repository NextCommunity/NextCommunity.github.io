bio: |
  I’m the founder of Runiverse, an Indian-first running and wellness platform
  focused on helping everyday people build sustainable fitness habits.

  I’m a full-stack developer with hands-on experience building and shipping
  real-world products, including mobile apps, Chrome extensions, and automation
  systems. My work spans frontend, backend, and product execution — from idea
  to launch.

  My technical stack includes React, Expo, Node.js, REST APIs, and automation
  workflows using n8n. I enjoy building systems that are simple, scalable,
  and deeply user-centric.

  Beyond code, I’m passionate about entrepreneurship, product strategy,
  community-driven growth, and creating technology tailored for real users,
  especially in the Indian context.

  Currently focused on launching and scaling Runiverse, while continuously
  learning and iterating through real product feedback.

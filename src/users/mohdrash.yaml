bio: |

    I'm a Keralite. From a place of beauty and nature. Since my childhood, i love sports (like football and MMA), hiking mountains, cooking, eating and drawing. I always try to draw stuff with my unique point of view. I also love to create things that can be useful to others.
    I started coding since I was in high school. I just got volunteered with a game developers community called 'Gametop' and was part in the development of two games 'sudden strike, sudden strike Iwo Jima' Coding is also an art for me like I love to hike mountains. I was absolute noob when it comes to code html, css, and js during my College time, I'm only familiar with C++ and Arduino. That I even tried to be like broken. It becomes my favourite part when I was joined in Talrop, an Engineers world and later joined with a cyber security team under the mentorship of 'Mr.Gautam Kumawat'. I love it and now I have the opportunity to design along with the coding. My career become more stronger when I joined in Osperb Innovations that I learned a lot and still working. I find it really interesting and I enjoyed the process a lot.

    My vision is to make the world a better place. My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.

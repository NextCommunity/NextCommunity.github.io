  Hi! I'm Preethi Yadav, a software engineering student 
  passionate about building web applications and solving real-world problems with code. 
  I have experience in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python, and I enjoy exploring open-source projects
  and contributing to collaborative workflows. I’m particularly interested in full-stack development,
  creating intuitive user experiences, and learning new technologies to continuously grow as a developer.
